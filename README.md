# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Behavior with Dynamic Routes and Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when combining dynamic routes with data fetching.  The issue involves inconsistencies in how data is fetched and rendered, leading to unexpected results or errors depending on the navigation method.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/post/1` (should work).
5. Navigate to `/post/2` (might not work or show unexpected data).

## Expected Behavior

Data should be fetched correctly and displayed consistently regardless of the navigation method (direct link, client-side navigation, etc.).

## Actual Behavior

In some scenarios, data fetching fails, or incorrect data is displayed.  This seems to be related to the interaction between dynamic routes and how Next.js handles the revalidation or caching of data.

## Possible Solutions (Investigate)

* Re-evaluating data fetching strategies within the app router's context.
* Exploring potential issues with caching mechanisms.
* Examining how route parameters are handled in dynamic segments.
